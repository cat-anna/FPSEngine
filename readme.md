# FPSEngine

This project was done probably around 2008 and never received a proper name. It is written entirely in delphi and compiled by some Borland Delphi compiler. This is one of my oldest project.
There is a lot of bugs in this project that never got fix.

# Major features
 * Internally uses pascal scripts to handle some events. 
 * Can load proper zip modules
 * Has dedicated graphical editor 
 * Can play sounds/music using bass sound lib
 * I still have working binaries :)
